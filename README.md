==============

What type of game is this?
RPG using a 2D tile engine programmed in C++ with SDL. It's currently only targetting windows. 

Why make another game?
I want to try and make a story driven game ala Robert E. Howards Conan series. This game will help tell many of the imaginary stories in my head. 

How is the code laid out? 
This game is infancy and as structure emerges so will the documentation. I'm using an iterative bottom up design and such there's not much planning.
