                Map Editor using my winapi lib. For simplicity sake, mobs stats and
                special functionality will be taken care by the source code. In my
                future editors, if I know a scripting language and feel it won't
                take foreverz, I'll rig the editor to do entity scripting.

                Game Overview: UO(highly simplified) meets Zelda meets Gauntlet meets Diablo. 
            </h3>
            <p>
                You run around killing monsters, leveling up your skills, collecting treasure
                all in the hopes of beating the bad guy at the end of the level. This is a non-arcade 
                game, there will be no timer or gradually losing health. The player can go at their
                own leisure, but the action will be very arcade like. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The map is made in a map editor with both spawns and individually placed mobs. I want 
                there to be at least 3 well made maps. In an ideal world I'd make 10 :D
            </p>
            <p>
                The leveling up system is so you can defeat tougher monsters, using your skills on them levels you up. 
            </p>
            <p>
                You know how hard a monster is by the difficulty flag, grey, green, yellow, red. 
            </p>
            <p>
              You can either be a warrior or a mage. There will only be one skill for each type. Warrior is swords,
              mage is magic. As you level up, your weapons and spell effects change color and the damage increases.
              To balance the range advantage of the mage, the mage will have less health and do slightly less dmg.
