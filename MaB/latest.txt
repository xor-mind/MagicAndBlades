need to add the ability to answer questions in the dialog. tomorrow I'm going to have to refactor the game a bit. 
I need rigorous structure. I need a class with a: "camera, world, entities", and every game object should have access to this.
this way I don't have to pass around camera or some other entity over and and over.

So the entity events are looking robust enough to work in this game.

I need to just get a dialog with some text up on and and the ability to type/choose an answer
and my little POC for a daemon and human talking will be complete! FUN FUN

todo:

high priority:

- add input for dialogs

low priority:

- get entity/game/map design tightend.
